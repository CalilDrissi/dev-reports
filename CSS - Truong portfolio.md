it was a very simple project , simple html markup and vanilla css.

yet  my struggle was real, i really struggled.


-----------------------------
mistakes I made?

-no design decision while coding css. 
-no responsiveness untill whole website is complete

- I struggle writing content on the page and deciding the html markup tree structure. 
- I work with haste like I'm runnig from a tiger.
-bad at naming classes really is a struggle for me.
-bad at ordering css declarations.

## Guidelines

what can I do better -- advice for my next project. 

1. writing the html markup on my own from scratch makes it easier to build.


2. write every section first in the html markup


3. think about what do write before you write it. graphic design or diagrams  & descriptions of what to create with code is key to success. define what you are building first and cut it into steps.
