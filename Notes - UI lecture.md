With no content building UI  is impossible. 



### I need the content for calil.tech.

## begin sketch design - responsive

build with illustration you have at hand then find alternatives after firt iterations.

the list:
a personal photograph.

name & what I do.  

good design is about iteration cycles not pre-planning to get things right on the first go.

the first go is for filling the page.

ideas to add for version 02

I have to practice some css. 

and then build the layout of the page. 

---
so my focus will be on building responsive webdesigns with sketch.

I will make it frictionless , it will be easy peasy by the end of today.

also begin css today.  create roadmap to follow & start it today. 

also begin js today.  create roadmap to follow 

---
the more time you spend on activity today the easier it will be the next day.
